Linux dependencies for xnu
==========================

Building on XNU (on a Linux host) requires:
   - cctools-839 or later
   - ld64-139.4 or later
   - LLVM 3.3 or later
   - bootstrap_cmds-60 or later (migcom/mig only)
   - clang/clang++

For the sake of your sanity, the following archive contains:
   - cctools-839
   - ld64-139.4
   - mig from bootstrap_cmds-60

These binaries are compiled for a Linux 32-bit host and also require
LLVM 3.3.
