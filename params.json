{"name":"Darwin/ARM Project","tagline":"Porting the Darwin kernel to the ARM architecture.","body":"## Welcome to Darwin/ARM\r\n\r\nWelcome to Darwin/ARM. Darwin is the core operating system that lies under both iPhone OS and Mac OS X. It mainly consists of the kernel and various other core components such as `dyld`, `launchd` and such. Over time, Apple has not really paid much attention to their open-source releases as present on the [open source portal](http://opensource.apple.com), including not publishing code for the ARM version of the `xnu` kernel.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to fill that gap.\r\n\r\n### IRC\r\n\r\nFeel free to join us in `##darwin-on-arm` on Freenode. \r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nDarwin/ARM runs on a variety of ARM reference platforms and hardware such as:\r\n\r\n* ARM RealView (Platform Baseboard for Cortex-A8/Emulation Baseboard)\r\n* Texas Instruments DM3730 (BeagleBoard xM)\r\n* Texas Instruments Sitara AM335x (BeagleBone)\r\n* Samsung S5L89xx (All ARMv7 platforms from 8920 to 8930).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the kernel can perform a variety of tasks, including running unmodified binaries from iPhone OS.\r\n\r\n### Userspace\r\n\r\nCurrently, the userspace is very simple, with the FreeBSD `init`, a simple runcom script and a getty. Multiuser does work at the moment. Many CoreFoundation/IOKit apps run at the moment, such as `sw_vers`, or `ioreg`.\r\n\r\nThe OS is incredibly volatile, so be warned! (There are dragons lurking around.)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n* [`dyld` crashing and demo of multiuser and privilege separation.](http://cl.ly/image/3V3t3511050P)\r\n* [`ioreg`, `uname` and `hostinfo` output](http://cl.ly/image/1L380u0l3Y1w)\r\n* [Multiuser `id` and `pwd` output for home directories](http://cl.ly/image/0z3i1D2k2545)\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nBuilding is relatively simple if you're on OS X, simply compile `ctfmerge`, `ctfconvert` and `ctfdump` from the `dtrace` package. Then check out the kernel source and simply build for your platform using `make TARGET_CONFIGS=\"debug arm <platform>\".\r\n\r\nA sample boot loader is also available [here](http://github.com/winocm/GenericBooter) for ARM RealView PB-A8 and OMAP3.\r\n\r\nGeneral purpose kernelcache build support coming soon! (Kernelcaches can currently be used, but building is rather unorthodox at the moment)\r\n\r\nHave fun and happy hacking!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
